            <h2>BMW X5</h2>
            <p>The 2023 BMW X5 is a luxury midsize SUV that combines versatility,
               performance, and refined comfort. It's available with a range of engines,
               from a turbocharged inline-6 to a more potent V8,
               and even offers a plug-in hybrid variant, all featuring BMW's TwinPower Turbo technology. 
               The X5 provides an engaging driving experience typical of BMW, along with the practicality of an SUV. 
               It comes standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission and BMW's intelligent xDrive all-wheel-drive system. 
               The interior is spacious and luxuriously appointed,
